# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts a student's exam score based on:
- Study hours
- Attendance percentage  

A Machine Learning model is trained using Linear Regression to estimate student performance from historical data.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Teachers often need to predict student performance based on study habits and attendance.  
This project uses Machine Learning to automate that prediction process.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- VS Code
- Git & GitHub

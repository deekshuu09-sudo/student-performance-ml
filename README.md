# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts a student's exam score based on two important factors:
- Study hours
- Attendance percentage

A Machine Learning model (Linear Regression) is trained on sample student data to predict scores for new students.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Teachers often estimate student performance based on study habits and attendance.  
This project uses Machine Learning to automate and improve this prediction using historical data.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- VS Code
- Git & GitHub
